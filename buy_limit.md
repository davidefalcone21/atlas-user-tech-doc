# User Action Requirement: Buy Coin (Limit Order)

---

## 1. Overview

- **User Action:**  
  `Buy Coin (Limit Order)`

- **Short Description:**  
  Allows users to create conditional buy orders that execute only when a token reaches a specific price or market cap target. The order includes parameters for amount, trigger conditions, and expiration time.

- **Scope:**  
  Chain-specific advanced trading function that enables users to set up automated buys at their desired entry points without constantly monitoring the market.

## 2. Detailed Functionality

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Input / Parameters:**
    - **Entry Point 1:** User sends contract address directly to the chat, then switches to LIMIT mode
    - **Entry Point 2:** User clicks "Buy" button, provides contract address when prompted, then switches to LIMIT mode
    - **Additional parameters:**
        - Wallet selection
        - Swap/Limit/DCA mode selection (LIMIT selected)
        - Buy/Sell mode selection

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  The process has three main stages:

    2. Limit Order Configuration: Interactive buttons for setting all order parameters including trigger price and expiry
    3. Order Creation Confirmation: Details of the created order and monitoring status

- **User Interface Behavior:**  
  **Stage 1: Token Information Display**
  ```

  ```

  **Stage 3: Order Creation Messages**
    - Confirmation message: "Limit order created: Buy [Amount] [Native Token] worth of [Token Symbol] when price reaches [Trigger Price] or market cap reaches [Market Cap Target]. Order expires in [Expiry Time]. You will be notified when the order executes."

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User initiates the process by either:
    - Sending a contract address directly to the chat
    - Clicking "Buy" button and then providing the contract address when prompted

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain and retrieves token information (same as Swap function).

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the full order configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User selects "LIMIT" mode from the trade type options.

- **Step 5:** User configures the limit order by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming buy mode (vs. sell)
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting an amount of native token for the order (preset buttons or custom)
    - Setting the trigger price (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Setting the order expiration time (default 4H)

- **Step 6:** User clicks "CREATE ORDER" to finalize the limit order.

- **Step 7:** Bot confirms the order creation with details and begins monitoring the market for the trigger condition.

- **Step 8:** If the trigger condition is met before expiration:
    - Bot executes the buy order with the specified parameters
    - User receives notification with transaction details and confirmation
    - Bot updates the message with the successful execution and final details

- **Step 9:** If the order expires without the trigger condition being met:
    - Bot cancels the order
    - User receives notification that the order has expired
    - No transaction is executed
