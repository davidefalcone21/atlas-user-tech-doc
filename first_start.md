# User Action Requirement: /start Command

---

## 1. Overview

- **User Action:**  
  `/start`

- **Short Description:**  
  The initial command that introduces the user to the trading bot and prompts them to either import an existing wallet or create a new one, followed by chain selection.

- **Scope:**  
  Multi-chain onboarding process that establishes the foundational wallet connection required for all subsequent trading activities.

## 2. Detailed Functionality

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Input / Parameters:**
    - **Command:** `/start` - Initiates the bot interaction
    - **No additional parameters required**

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  User receives a welcome message with information about the bot's capabilities, along with interactive buttons to either import an existing wallet or create a new one. After wallet selection, the user is prompted to select which blockchain network they want to use (SOL, ETH, BNB, BASE, or TON).

- **User Interface Behavior:**  
  The bot responds with a welcome message and an inline keyboard containing two primary buttons:
    1. "Import Wallet" - For users with existing wallets
    2. "Create Wallet" - For users who need a new wallet

  After the wallet action is selected, a second inline keyboard appears with chain selection options:
    1. "SOL" - Solana blockchain
    2. "ETH" - Ethereum blockchain
    3. "BNB" - Binance Smart Chain
    4. "BASE" - Base blockchain
    5. "TON" - TON blockchain

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User sends the `/start` command to the bot.
- **Step 2:** Bot responds with a welcome message and displays the wallet options (Import/Create).
- **Step 3:** User selects one of the wallet options.
- **Step 4:** Bot acknowledges the selection and displays the chain selection options (SOL, ETH, BNB, BASE, TON).
- **Step 5:** User selects a blockchain network.
- **Step 6:** Bot confirms the selected chain and either proceeds with wallet import instructions or wallet creation process depending on the user's earlier selection.

## 3. Affected Systems and Dependencies

- **Chain Specific Requirements:**  
  `[Indicate if this action is chain-specific. For example, “This action applies only to the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum networks” or “This action displays portfolio data across all chains, with sorting options by chain.”]`

- **Integration Points:**
    - **Telegram API:** `[Details regarding message formatting, command parsing, etc.]`
    - **External Trading APIs / Exchanges:** `[Details on order submission, tracking, and status updates.]`
    - **Blockchain Network APIs:** `[Details on blockchain-specific requirements such as fee calculations, chain validations, etc.]`
    - **Signal Providers (if applicable):** `[Describe how signals affect this action.]`

- **Portfolio / Order Management:**  
  `[Specify how this action interacts with the portfolio system (e.g., updating portfolio balances, order histories, etc.).]`

- **Other Systems:**  
  `[List any other affected or integrated systems.]`

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Common Error Scenarios:**
    - `[Describe a scenario, e.g., “Invalid order parameters” and how the bot should respond.]`
    - `[Example: “User tries to cancel an order that does not exist.”]`

- **Validation & Fallback Mechanisms:**  
  `[Detail any input validations, fallback procedures, or safety checks that should be in place.]`

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  `[Specify performance metrics such as maximum response time or acceptable latency.]`

- **Security:**  
  `[Outline security measures including data encryption, authentication, and secure session management.]`

- **Scalability:**  
  `[Discuss how the system should handle growth in user base and transaction volume.]`

- **Usability:**  
  `[Provide guidelines on the user experience, including clarity of commands and response messages.]`

## 6. Future Enhancements

- `[List any potential improvements or additional features that could be implemented in future releases.]`

**Notes:**
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[Action Name]`) with the specific details for the user action.
- Use this template to create individual requirement specification pages for each user action (e.g., `/start`, `/place_limit_order`, `/cancel_order`, `/order_status`, etc.).
- Ensure that each requirement clearly defines how the action functions and its impact on related systems.
