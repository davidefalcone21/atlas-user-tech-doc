- **Integration Points:**  
  - **Telegram API:** `[Details regarding message formatting, command parsing, etc.]`
  - **External Trading APIs / Exchanges:** `[Details on order submission, tracking, and status updates.]`
  - **Blockchain Network APIs:** `[Details on blockchain-specific requirements such as fee calculations, chain validations, etc.]`
  - **Signal Providers (if applicable):** `[Describe how signals affect this action.]`

- **Portfolio / Order Management:**  
  `[Specify how this action interacts with the portfolio system (e.g., updating portfolio balances, order histories, etc.).]`

- **Other Systems:**  
  `[List any other affected or integrated systems.]`

**Notes:**  
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[Action Name]`) with the specific details for the user action.  
- Use this template to create individual requirement specification pages for each user action (e.g., `/start`, `/place_limit_order`, `/cancel_order`, `/order_status`, etc.).  
- Ensure that each requirement clearly defines how the action functions and its impact on related systems.
