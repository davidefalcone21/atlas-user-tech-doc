# User Action Requirement: /wallets Command

---

## 1. Overview

- **User Action:**  
  `/wallets`

- **Short Description:**  
  Displays all available wallets for each blockchain and allows the user to select their default wallet for each chain.

- **Scope:**  
  Multi-chain wallet management interface that controls which wallet is used as the default for transactions on each supported blockchain.

## 2. Detailed Functionality

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Input / Parameters:**
    - **Command:** `/wallets` - Initiates the wallet selection interface
    - **No additional parameters required**

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  User sees a list of their current default wallets across all chains, followed by a navigation interface that allows them to browse through their wallets for each specific chain and select a new default wallet.

- **User Interface Behavior:**  
  The bot responds with:
    1. A message showing current default wallets for all chains
    2. A chain-specific wallet selection interface with:
        - Chain navigation buttons (<- and ->) to switch between chains (SOL, ETH, BNB, BASE, TON)
        - Current chain indicator (e.g., "SOL")
        - Wallet selection buttons (W1, W2, W3, etc.) with the current default wallet marked with a green tick (✓)

  **Message structure:**
  ```
  Your Default Wallets:
  
  SOL: [Wallet Address 1]
  ETH: [Wallet Address 2]
  BNB: [Wallet Address 1]
  BASE: [Wallet Address 3]
  TON: [Wallet Address 2]
  
  Select your default wallet for:
  ```

  **Button Layout:**
  Row 1: "<-" | "SOL" | "->"
  Row 2: "W1 ✓" | "W2" | "W3" (where ✓ indicates current default)
  Row 3: "Create New Wallet" | "Import Wallet"


### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User sends the `/wallets` command.
- **Step 2:** Bot retrieves all wallet information for the user across all supported chains.
- **Step 3:** Bot displays the current default wallets for each chain in a list format.
- **Step 4:** Bot shows the wallet selection interface for the first chain (SOL by default).
- **Step 5:** User can navigate between chains using the "<-" and "->" buttons.
- **Step 6:** For each chain, user can select a new default wallet by tapping on one of the wallet buttons (W1, W2, W3, etc.).
- **Step 7:** When a wallet is selected, the bot updates the default wallet for that chain, refreshes the display with the green tick (✓) on the newly selected wallet, and updates the default wallets list at the top of the message.

## 3. Affected Systems and Dependencies

- **Chain Specific Requirements:**  
  `[Indicate if this action is chain-specific. For example, “This action applies only to the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum networks” or “This action displays portfolio data across all chains, with sorting options by chain.”]`

- **Integration Points:**
    - **Telegram API:** `[Details regarding message formatting, command parsing, etc.]`
    - **External Trading APIs / Exchanges:** `[Details on order submission, tracking, and status updates.]`
    - **Blockchain Network APIs:** `[Details on blockchain-specific requirements such as fee calculations, chain validations, etc.]`
    - **Signal Providers (if applicable):** `[Describe how signals affect this action.]`

- **Portfolio / Order Management:**  
  `[Specify how this action interacts with the portfolio system (e.g., updating portfolio balances, order histories, etc.).]`

- **Other Systems:**  
  `[List any other affected or integrated systems.]`

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Common Error Scenarios:**
    - `[Describe a scenario, e.g., “Invalid order parameters” and how the bot should respond.]`
    - `[Example: “User tries to cancel an order that does not exist.”]`

- **Validation & Fallback Mechanisms:**  
  `[Detail any input validations, fallback procedures, or safety checks that should be in place.]`

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  `[Specify performance metrics such as maximum response time or acceptable latency.]`

- **Security:**  
  `[Outline security measures including data encryption, authentication, and secure session management.]`

- **Scalability:**  
  `[Discuss how the system should handle growth in user base and transaction volume.]`

- **Usability:**  
  `[Provide guidelines on the user experience, including clarity of commands and response messages.]`

## 6. Future Enhancements

- `[List any potential improvements or additional features that could be implemented in future releases.]`

**Notes:**
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[Action Name]`) with the specific details for the user action.
- Use this template to create individual requirement specification pages for each user action (e.g., `/start`, `/place_limit_order`, `/cancel_order`, `/order_status`, etc.).
- Ensure that each requirement clearly defines how the action functions and its impact on related systems.
