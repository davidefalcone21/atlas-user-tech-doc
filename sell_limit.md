### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User initiates the process by either:
    - Sending a contract address directly to the chat and switching to SELL mode, then LIMIT mode
    - Clicking "Sell" button, providing the contract address when prompted, then switching to LIMIT mode
    - Clicking "Sell [Token]" from positions screen, then switching to LIMIT mode

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain and retrieves token information.

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the limit sell configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User configures the limit sell order by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming LIMIT mode and SELL mode
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting an amount or percentage to sell:
        - Using preset native token value buttons
        - Using preset percentage buttons (25%, 50%)
        - Entering a custom amount in native token value
        - Entering a custom percentage
        - Selecting special options (INITIALS, 100%, 100% TO PGN)
    - Setting the trigger price (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Setting the order expiration time (default 4H)

- **Step 5:** User clicks "CREATE ORDER" to finalize the limit sell order.

- **Step 6:** Bot confirms the order creation with details and begins monitoring the market for the trigger condition.

- **Step 7:** If the trigger condition is met before expiration:
    - Bot executes the sell order with the specified parameters
    - User receives notification with transaction details and confirmation
    - Bot updates the message with the successful execution and final details

- **Step 8:** If the order expires without the trigger condition being met:
    - Bot cancels the order
    - User receives notification that the order has expired
    - No transaction is executed
