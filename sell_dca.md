### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User initiates the process by one of the entry points and switches to DCA mode in SELL direction.

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain and retrieves token information.

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the DCA sell configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User configures the DCA sell strategy by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming DCA mode and SELL mode
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting an amount or percentage to sell over the DCA period:
        - Using preset native token value buttons
        - Using preset percentage buttons (25%, 50%)
        - Entering a custom amount in native token value
        - Entering a custom percentage
        - Selecting special options (INITIALS, 100%, 100% TO PGN)
    - Setting the minimum price boundary (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Setting the maximum price boundary (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Confirming or adjusting the time interval between sales (default 30m)
    - Confirming or adjusting the total duration of the DCA strategy (default 12h)

- **Step 5:** User clicks "CREATE ORDER" to finalize the DCA sell strategy.

- **Step 6:** Bot confirms the strategy creation with details and begins the automated DCA process.

- **Step 7:** For each interval during the specified duration:
    - Bot checks if the current price is within the specified range (min to max price)
    - If in range, executes a proportional sell order based on the interval and total amount/percentage
    - User receives notification with transaction details after each execution
    - Bot updates the strategy status with progress and remaining tokens to sell

- **Step 8:** When the strategy completes (duration reached or total amount/percentage sold):
    - Bot sends a final summary of all executions
    - User receives total native tokens acquired, average sale price, and other statistics
