    - **Entry Point 2:** User clicks "Buy" button, provides contract address when prompted, then switches to DCA mode
    - **Additional parameters:**
        - Wallet selection
        - Swap/Limit/DCA mode selection (DCA selected)
        - Buy/Sell mode selection
        - Slippage setting

        - Time interval between purchases (e.g., 30m)
        - Total duration of the DCA strategy (e.g., 12h)

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  The process has three main stages:

    2. DCA Strategy Configuration: Interactive buttons for setting all parameters including price boundaries, intervals, and duration
    3. Strategy Creation Confirmation: Details of the created DCA strategy and monitoring status

  ```

  **Stage 3: DCA Creation Messages**
    - Confirmation message: "DCA strategy created: Total investment of [Amount] [Native Token] into [Token Symbol] spread over [Duration] with purchases every [Interval]. Price range: $[Min Price] to $[Max Price]. The first purchase will execute shortly. You will be notified after each execution."

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User initiates the process by either:
    - Sending a contract address directly to the chat
    - Clicking "Buy" button and then providing the contract address when prompted

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain and retrieves token information (same as Swap/Limit functions).

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the DCA configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User selects "DCA" mode from the trade type options.

- **Step 5:** User configures the DCA strategy by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming buy mode (vs. sell)
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting the total amount of native token for the entire DCA strategy
    - Setting the minimum price boundary (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Setting the maximum price boundary (can be USD price or market cap value)
    - Confirming or adjusting the time interval between purchases (default 30m)
    - Confirming or adjusting the total duration of the DCA strategy (default 12h)

- **Step 6:** User clicks "CREATE ORDER" to finalize the DCA strategy.

- **Step 7:** Bot confirms the strategy creation with details and begins the automated DCA process.
- Call back button to return to see list of open orders

- **Step 8:** For each interval during the specified duration:
    - Bot checks if the current price is within the specified range (min to max price)
    - If in range, executes a proportional buy order based on the interval and total amount
    - User receives notification with transaction details after each execution
    - Bot updates the strategy status with progress and remaining budget

- **Step 9:** When the strategy completes (duration reached or total amount used):
    - Bot sends a final summary of all executions
    - User receives total tokens acquired, average purchase price, and other statistics
    - Call back button to return to positions of the wallet
