    3. Transaction Execution: Progress updates and confirmation details

- **User Interface Behavior:**  
  **Stage 1: Token Information Display**
  ```

  Row 10:
  "CONFIRM"
  ```

  **Stage 3: Transaction Messages**
    - Waiting message: "Transaction initiated: Swapping [Amount] [Native Token] for approximately [Token Amount] [Token Symbol]... Please wait."
    - Confirmation message: "Transaction confirmed! [Transaction Explorer Link]"

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User initiates the buy process by either:
    - Sending a contract address directly to the chat
    - Clicking "Buy" button and then providing the contract address when prompted

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain based on the contract address format and retrieves token information including:
    - Token name, symbol, and contract details
    - Security status (mint/freeze renounced)
    - Market metrics (market cap, liquidity, price)
    - Volume data (5m, 15m, 1h, 24h)
    - User's current balance of both native token and the selected token

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the full trade configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User configures the trade by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming swap mode (vs. limit or DCA)
    - Confirming buy mode (vs. sell)
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting an amount of native token to swap (preset buttons or custom)

- **Step 5:** User clicks "CONFIRM" to execute the transaction.

- **Step 6:** Bot displays waiting message with transaction details and initiates the swap on the selected blockchain.

- **Step 7:** Once transaction is confirmed on-chain, bot updates the message with:
    - Confirmation status
    - Link to transaction on blockchain explorer
    - Final amount of tokens received
    - Call back button to return to positions of the wallet

- Use this template to create individual requirement specification pages for each user action (e.g., `/start`, `/place_limit_order`, `/cancel_order`, `/order_status`, etc.).
- Ensure that each requirement clearly defines how the action functions and its impact on related systems.
