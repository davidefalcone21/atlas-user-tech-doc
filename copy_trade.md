### 2.2 Process Flow

- **Step 3:** User either:
    - Selects an existing copy trade setup to manage it
    - Clicks "NEW +" to create a new copy trade setup

- **Step 4:** If creating a new setup, user configures:
    - Chain: Selects which blockchain to track (SOL, ETH, BNB, BASE, TON)
    - Tag: Clicks "Tag: --" button and enters a memorable name for this target wallet
    - Wallet Address: Clicks "Wallet Address: --" button and enters the address to track
    - Buy Size: Clicks "Buy Size: --" button and enters either:
        - A percentage (e.g., "50%") to use 50% of the relative amount the target uses
        - A fixed amount (e.g., "0.5 SOL") to always use the same amount regardless of target's trade size
    - Copy Sells: Toggles whether to also automatically sell when the target wallet sells

    - For buys: If copy trade is active, bot automatically buys the same token using the configured parameters
    - For sells: If copy trade is active AND copy sells is enabled, bot automatically sells the token
    - For each automated transaction, the bot sends a notification message to the user:
        - "Copy Trade Alert: [WALLETTAG] bought [TOKEN] - Your bot has automatically purchased [AMOUNT] [TOKEN] for [COST] [NATIVE TOKEN]. [TRANSACTION LINK]"
        - "Copy Trade Alert: [WALLETTAG] sold [TOKEN] - Your bot has automatically sold [AMOUNT] [TOKEN] for [RECEIVED] [NATIVE TOKEN]. [TRANSACTION LINK]"

- **Step 8:** User can manage existing copy trade setups by:
