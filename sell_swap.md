    - Sending a contract address directly to the chat and switching to SELL mode
    - Clicking "Sell" button and then providing the contract address when prompted
    - Clicking "Sell [Token]" from the positions screen

- **Step 2:** Bot automatically identifies the blockchain based on the contract address format and retrieves token information including:
    - Token name, symbol, and contract details
    - Security status (mint/freeze renounced)
    - Market metrics (market cap, liquidity, price)
    - Volume data (5m, 15m, 1h, 24h)
    - User's current balance of both native token and the selected token

- **Step 3:** Bot displays comprehensive token information and the full sell configuration interface.

- **Step 4:** User configures the sell order by:
    - Selecting the desired wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons
    - Confirming swap mode (vs. limit or DCA)
    - Confirming sell mode
    - Setting slippage if desired
    - Setting Anti-MEV protection if desired
    - Setting priority fee/tip if desired
    - Selecting an amount or percentage to sell:
        - Using preset native token value buttons
        - Using preset percentage buttons (25%, 50%)
        - Entering a custom amount in native token value
        - Entering a custom percentage
        - Selecting special options (INITIALS, 100%, 100% TO PGN)

- **Step 5:** User clicks "CONFIRM" to execute the transaction.

- **Step 6:** Bot displays waiting message with transaction details and initiates the swap on the selected blockchain.

- **Step 7:** Once transaction is confirmed on-chain, bot updates the message with:
    - Confirmation status
    - Link to transaction on blockchain explorer
    - Final amount of native tokens received
    - Updated wallet balances

- **Special Note on Sell Options:**
    - "SELL INITIALS": Sells only the initial investment amount, preserving profits
    - "SELL 100%": Sells the entire token balance for native tokens
    - "SELL 100% TO PGN": Available only on Solana chain, sells the entire token balance for PGN tokens instead of SOL
