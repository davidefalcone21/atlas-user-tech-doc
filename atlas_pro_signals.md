### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User navigates to "Atlas Pro Settings" from the main menu.
    - If user does not have 1,000,000+ PGN tokens, they receive a message indicating this is a Gold tier feature and are returned to the main menu.
    - If user has Gold tier status, they proceed to the Prometheus Integration settings.

- **Step 2:** Bot displays the current Prometheus Integration settings with activation status and configuration parameters.

- **Step 3:** User configures the automated response to Prometheus signals:
    - Auto Buy: User toggles whether to automatically buy tokens when Prometheus sends buy signals
    - Auto Sell: User toggles whether to automatically sell initial investment when Prometheus sends sell signals
    - Buy Size: User clicks "Buy Size" button and enters the amount of native token to use for each automated buy
    - Slippage: User clicks "Slippage" button and enters the percentage to allow for automated trades
    - Fee Settings: User configures priority fee, tip, and anti-MEV settings for automated trades

- **Step 4:** User clicks "Back to Menu" to save settings and return to the main menu.

- **Step 5:** When Prometheus sends signals to Atlas (via API endpoint):
    - For Buy Signals:
        - If Auto Buy is enabled, bot automatically purchases the token using the configured buy size and parameters
        - User receives notification of the automated purchase with transaction details
        - If Auto Sell profiles are configured, they are automatically applied to this purchase

    - For Sell Signals:
        - If Auto Sell is enabled, bot automatically sells the initial investment amount of the specified token
        - User receives notification of the automated sell with transaction details
