    - **Entry Point:** User clicks "Sell Dust for PGN" button from main menu
    - **Additional parameters:**
        - Wallet selection
        - Dust threshold value in USD
        - Confirmation of action

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  Bot identifies all token balances below the specified threshold (excluding native tokens and stablecoins), calculates their combined value, and executes optimized transactions to convert them all to PGN tokens. User receives a summary of the conversion process with total value consolidated.

- **User Interface Behavior:**  
  **Initial Information Screen:**
  ```
  üìä Sell Dust for PGN
  
  This feature will automatically swap all your small token balances (dust) below the specified threshold into PGN tokens.
  
  Assets excluded from conversion:
  ‚Ä¢ Native tokens (SOL, ETH, BNB, etc.)
  ‚Ä¢ Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.)
  
  Current Settings:
  - Selected Wallet: [Wallet Name]
  - Dust Threshold: $[Amount] USD
  
  Tokens Identified as Dust:
  [Number] tokens with total value approximately $[Combined Value] USD
  ```

  **Buttons:**
  ```
  Row 1:
  "‚¨ÖÔ∏è PREV" | "[WALLET NAME]" | "‚û°Ô∏è NEXT" (wallet selection)
  
  Row 2:
  "Dust Threshold: $[Value]" (configurable threshold)
  
  Row 3:
  "View Dust Tokens" (shows detailed list of tokens to be converted)
  
  Row 4:
  "CONVERT TO PGN" (confirmation button)
  
  Row 5:

  ```

  **Dust Tokens Detail Screen (when "View Dust Tokens" is clicked):**
  ```
  Dust Tokens in [Wallet Name]:
  
  1. [Token Symbol 1]: [Amount] ($[USD Value])
  2. [Token Symbol 2]: [Amount] ($[USD Value])
  3. [Token Symbol 3]: [Amount] ($[USD Value])
  ...
  
  Total Value: $[Combined Value] USD
  Estimated PGN to Receive: ~[PGN Amount] PGN
  ```

  **Confirmation and Processing Screen:**
  ```
  Converting Dust to PGN...
  
  The bot is now executing optimized swaps to convert [Number] dust tokens to PGN.
  This process may require multiple transactions to complete efficiently.
  
  Status: [In Progress/Complete]
  Transactions: [Completed]/[Total]
  
  Please wait while your dust is being converted...
  ```

  **Completion Screen:**
  ```
  Dust Conversion Complete!
  
  Successfully converted [Number] tokens to PGN:
  ‚Ä¢ Total Value Converted: $[Value] USD
  ‚Ä¢ PGN Received: [Amount] PGN
  ‚Ä¢ Gas Spent: [Amount] [Native Token]
  
  Your wallet is now cleaner and your PGN balance has increased!
  ```

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User clicks the "Sell Dust for PGN" button from the main menu.

- **Step 2:** Bot analyzes the selected wallet and identifies all token balances below the current dust threshold, excluding native tokens and stablecoins.

- **Step 3:** Bot displays the initial information screen with the count and combined value of dust tokens.

- **Step 4:** User can:
    - Change the selected wallet using PREV/NEXT buttons to apply the function to a different wallet
    - Adjust the dust threshold by clicking the "Dust Threshold" button and entering a new value
    - View detailed list of dust tokens by clicking "View Dust Tokens"
    - Proceed with conversion by clicking "CONVERT TO PGN"

- **Step 5:** If user clicks "CONVERT TO PGN", bot displays a confirmation message asking them to confirm the action.

- **Step 6:** Upon confirmation, bot initiates the conversion process:
    - Groups tokens by DEX or conversion route to optimize gas usage
    - Executes batched transactions where possible
    - Shows real-time progress of the conversion

- **Step 7:** Once all conversions are complete, bot displays the completion screen with detailed results:
    - Number of tokens converted
    - Total value converted
    - Amount of PGN received
    - Gas costs for the process

- **Step 8:** User can return to the main menu, with their wallet now containing fewer small token balances and an increased PGN position.
