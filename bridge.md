# User Action Requirement: Bridge

---

## 1. Overview

- **User Action:**  
  `Bridge`

- **Short Description:**  
  Allows users to seamlessly bridge native tokens and stablecoins between all supported chains (SOL, ETH, BNB, BASE, TON), with options to transfer between bot-managed wallets or to external addresses.

- **Scope:**  
  Cross-chain asset transfer utility that enables users to move their funds between different blockchains without leaving the bot interface, supporting both internal transfers between bot wallets and external transfers to any address.

## 2. Detailed Functionality

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Input / Parameters:**
    - **Entry Point:** User clicks "Bridge" button from main menu
    - **Additional parameters:**
        - Source chain and wallet
        - Destination chain and wallet (bot wallet or external address)
        - Asset to bridge (native tokens or stablecoins)
        - Amount to bridge
        - Bridge provider/route selection

- **Expected Outcome / Response:**  
  User can select assets from one chain and seamlessly transfer them to another supported chain, either to their bot-managed wallet on the destination chain or to an external wallet address. The bot handles all the complex bridging mechanics and provides status updates throughout the process.

### 2.2 Process Flow
- **Step 1:** User clicks the "Bridge" button from the main menu.

- **Step 2:** Bot displays the initial bridge screen where user can configure:
    - Source chain (which blockchain to bridge from)
    - Source wallet (which of their wallets on the source chain to use)
    - Destination chain (which blockchain to bridge to)
    - Destination wallet (bot-managed wallet or external address)

- **Step 3:** User clicks "Continue" to proceed to asset selection.

- **Step 4:** Bot displays available assets that can be bridged from the selected source chain:
    - Native tokens (SOL, ETH, BNB, etc.)
    - Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.)
    - Other supported tokens

- **Step 5:** User selects which asset to bridge and clicks "Continue".

- **Step 6:** Bot displays the amount and route selection screen where user can:
    - Enter the specific amount to bridge or use quick percentage buttons
    - View available bridge providers/routes with associated fees and time estimates
    - Select preferred bridge provider or use "Best Route" for automatic selection

- **Step 7:** User clicks "Bridge Now" to proceed.

- **Step 8:** Bot displays a confirmation screen with all details of the bridge transaction.

- **Step 9:** User confirms the transaction.

- **Step 10:** Bot initiates the bridging process:
    - Executes transaction on source chain
    - Monitors bridge progress
    - Updates status display in real-time
    - Confirms receipt on destination chain

- **Step 11:** Once bridging is complete, bot displays confirmation with transaction details:
    - Source transaction hash
    - Destination transaction hash
    - Final amount received (after fees)
    - Option to view transactions on respective block explorers

- **Step 12:** User can return to the main menu or perform another bridge operation.

**Notes:**
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[Action Name]`) with the specific details for the user action.
- Use this template to create individual requirement specification pages for each user action (e.g., `/start`, `/place_limit_order`, `/cancel_order`, `/order_status`, etc.).
- Ensure that each requirement clearly defines how the action functions and its impact on related systems.
